# Stacks & Queues

# LIFO
# Last In First Out

# lets say you have a tube container of tennis balls
# you place one in and then a second one
# the only tennis ball that can be taken out is the last one 
# if you have three tennis balls in the tube
# you dont have access to the second one anymore 
# you can only take out the third ball

# lets say we have a list 
# 11 3 23 7
#  0 1  2 3

# if we were to add a item at the end of that list
# Big O: O(1)

# BUT if we were to add an item to the front
# Big O: O(n)
# since we will need to go through the list
